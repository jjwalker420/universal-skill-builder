# Skill Writing Guide

## Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
```

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) — Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** — In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** — As needed (unlimited; scripts can execute without loading)

**Key patterns:**
- Target 300 lines, hard ceiling 350 for complex multi-mode skills; if approaching this limit, add an additional hierarchy layer with clear pointers to where to go next
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:
```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md
```
Claude reads only the relevant reference file.

## Principle of Lack of Surprise

Skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Roleplay skills are fine.

## Writing Patterns

Use the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats:**
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern:**
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

## Writing Style

Explain to the model *why* things are important rather than piling on heavy-handed MUSTs. Use theory of mind — make the skill general rather than narrowly tied to specific examples. Write a draft, then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, reframe and explain the reasoning instead. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.
